Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface and data upload functionality).
Backend: Python (Flask or Django) to handle file uploads, process data, and return cleaned data.
Database (optional): You may store processed data or logs using SQLite, PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL solution like MongoDB.
Data Processing Library: Use Python libraries such as Pandas for data cleaning and processing.
/my-data-cleaner-website
   /static
     /css
     /js
   /templates
     index.html
     results.html
   /uploads (this folder will store uploaded files)
   app.py (Flask app)
   requirements.txt (Python libraries)
   processing.py (Python data cleaning logic)
Once your app is working locally, you can deploy it to a platform like:

Heroku (for full-stack web apps)
AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean for more control
Netlify or Vercel (only for frontend)
You can configure gunicorn or uWSGI to serve the Flask app in production.

10. Future Enhancements
Add data validation: Ensure the uploaded data conforms to specific formats.
Authentication: Allow only registered users to upload files.
Improved Data Processing: Offer various cleaning options (e.g., fill missing data, standardize formats).
API support: Instead of web forms, allow users to send data via API calls.
With these steps, you can set up a full web-based data cleaning platform using Python and Flask. Let me know if you need help with a particular part of this setup!
